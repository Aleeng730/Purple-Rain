# Purple-Rain-in-Cplusplus
A simple simulation of "purple rain" based off The Coding Train's Challenge #4. Made using the raylib library and translated into C++

This includes modified code from the original Coding Challenge video. Some changes were made, such as using rectangles rather than lines (this is because rectangles allow for better control over size and thickness). This program also focuses more on depth and a more "3d" effect compared to the original video.

I'm still a beginner, so I apologize for any bad conventions :)
Enjoy!
